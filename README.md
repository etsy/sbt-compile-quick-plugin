# sbt-compile-quick-plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/etsy/sbt-compile-quick-plugin.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/etsy/sbt-compile-quick-plugin)

This project provides an SBT 0.13 (Scala 2.10) and 1.0 (Scala 2.12) plugin for compiling and packaging
a single file.

The implementation was based on an older implementation found
[here](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/240).

## Setup

Add the following lines to `project/plugins.sbt`

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.etsy" % "sbt-compile-quick-plugin" % "1.4.0")
```

sbt-compile-quick-plugin is an AutoPlugin, so there is no need to modify the `build.sbt` file to enable it.

## Usage

You can compile a single file with the `compileQuick` command.  It
supports tab-completing the file name.  You can also compile a single
test file with the `test:compileQuick` command.

You can produce a JAR without compiling any additional files with the
`packageQuick` command.  By default this will include all class files
located in `compile:classDirectory`.  You can add additional files to
be packaged by `packageQuick` by appending to the value of
`filesToPackage`.
